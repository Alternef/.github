# Alternef

The ship of alternatives.

## Vision

The Alternef is a computer science laboratory focused on distributed architecture aplied to education.

The long term goal is to develop and contributes to technologies that help to create distributed digital univercities.

Within the context of the Alternef, those technology will be put in practice by creating a distributed univercity around the thematic of the alternatives. The image is a ship that navigate accross the sea of possibilities.
